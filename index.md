## About

This is an open study guide for becoming a [Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcsa) (RHCSA)
by passing the [EX200 exam from Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex200-red-hat-certified-system-administrator-rhcsa-exam).
It includes written lessons, exercises, questions, and additional reading material.

This is meant to be an alternative to the [training courses for RHCSA certification](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcsa?pfe-zeueqhsom=training), namely
[RH065](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/rh065-running-containers-red-hat-technical-overview) (Running Containers with Red Hat Technical Overview),
[RH124](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/rh124-red-hat-system-administration-i) (Red Hat System Administration I),
and [RH134](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/rh124-red-hat-system-administration-i) (Red Hat System Administration II).

This guide is targeted towards [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) (RHEL) version 9,
which is the version of RHEL targeted by EX200 at the time of writing.
Sometimes general Linux knowledge is included where useful.

This guide has no express guarantee that you will pass any exam.

## Intended Audience

This guide is meant for anyone with some Linux experience looking to fill any gaps in their knowledge to become a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator.

This guide is recommended for self-directed learners who like reading.

## Using This Guide

This guide includes an [Exam Checklist](exam-checklist).
The checklist partially acts as an index of guide content and partially acts a way to check that you are ready for the exam.

The checklist refers to documentation from Red Hat.
Where possible, this guide preserves the order and wording used in Red Hat documentation, however it prioritizes structuring content in a self-contained logical way.

It is recommended that before starting, you review the checklist once.
If you have significant RHEL experience already, you may wish to use the checklist to find and focus on only the pages, exercises, and questions which you need.

You may optionally refer back to the checklist throughout this guide to find pages, questions, and exercises, and to track your progress.

After finishing this guide, refer back to the checklist and ensure every item is checked off before proceeding to your exam.
