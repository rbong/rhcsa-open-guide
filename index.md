## About

This is an open study guide for becoming a [Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcsa) (RHCSA)
by passing the [EX200 exam from Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex200-red-hat-certified-system-administrator-rhcsa-exam).
It includes written guides, exercises, and links to additional reading material.

This is meant to be an alternative to the [training courses for RHCSA](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcsa?pfe-zeueqhsom=training), namely

[RH124](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/rh124-red-hat-system-administration-i) (Red Hat System Administration I),
and [RH134](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/rh124-red-hat-system-administration-i) (Red Hat System Administration II).

This guide is targetted towards [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) (RHEL) version 9,
which is the version of RHEL targetted by EX200 at the time of writing.
Sometimes general Linux knowledge is included where useful.

## Intended Audience
