## About

This is an open study guide for becoming a [Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcsa) (RHCSA)
by passing the [EX200 exam from Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex200-red-hat-certified-system-administrator-rhcsa-exam).
It includes written lessons, exercises, questions, and other reading material.

This guide is an alternative to the following [training courses for RHCSA certification](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcsa?pfe-zeueqhsom=training):

- [RH065](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/rh065-running-containers-red-hat-technical-overview) (Running Containers with Red Hat Technical Overview)
- [RH124](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/rh124-red-hat-system-administration-i) (Red Hat System Administration I)
- [RH134](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/rh124-red-hat-system-administration-i) (Red Hat System Administration II)

This guide targets [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) (RHEL) version 9,
which is the version of RHEL targeted by EX200 at the time of writing.
This guide sometimes includes general Linux knowledge.

This guide doesn't guarantee that you will pass any exam.

## Intended audience

This guide is for anyone with some Linux experience looking to fill any gaps in their knowledge to become a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator.

This guide is for self-directed learners who like reading.

## Using this guide

### Exam checklist

This guide includes an [Exam Checklist](exam-checklist).
This checklist is a way to verify you are ready for the exam.
It also is an index of guide content.

The checklist refers to documentation from Red Hat.
Where possible, this guide preserves the order and wording used in Red Hat documentation, however it prioritizes structuring content in a self-contained logical way.

It's recommended that before starting, you review the checklist once.
If you have significant RHEL experience already, you may wish to use the checklist to find and focus on only the content which you need.

You may optionally refer back to the checklist throughout this guide to find content, and to track your progress.

After finishing this guide, refer back to the checklist and make sure to check off every item before proceeding to your exam.
